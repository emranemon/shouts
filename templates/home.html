  <p>Freedom and independence can sound like lofty concepts, 
    but how do they break down for the individual? 
    In the spirit of the Fourth of July, we have compiled 
    a list of seven inspiring quotes culled from a diverse group 
    of important figures  - from Coco Chanel to Socrates - whose 
    statements reflect the broad spectrum of meaning of the notions of freedom and independence. </p>
